# Motivation ðŸ’ª

LinkedIn is a very powerful tool to create your professional network. But it is not so easy to handle and manage that network well in LinkedIn. That's the proble that LeadDelta a SaaS product saw and fixed. It is a CRM for managing LinkedIn connection 100x better. When I saw the tool it was amazing and I got very curious as to how they would've made it. So I reverse engineered it and 2 months later created this clone. Throught this process I learned a lot about extension development, how extensions access differnet browser features and a lot about how linkedin handles it data.

# About Project

This is a chromium extension made in react with a backend in Node and mongodb. We do a CSRF attack on LinkedIn's Voyager API to get access to the data. Then in the clean UI of the CRM we show the connections in a tabular format with loads of features like:
- **Global Search :** Search for a keyword and it will filter out the list of connections who have the keyword in their name, tagline, company or bio.
- **Download CSV :** Download CSV of the connections wth their data.
- **Auto Update :** Automatically updates connections with latest profile info.
- **Tags :** Create and assign tags to connections and filter them through it.
- **Bulk Messaging :** Send Bulk Messages to max 50 connections at the same time.
- **Others :** Follow, unfollow, disconnect, message all from the same dashboard.
